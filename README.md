- [Run the workshop in a cloud-computing environment](https://github.com/tuftsdatalab/intro-r#running-the-workshop-in-a-cloud-computing-environment) *(does not require the installation of additional software)*
- [Run the workshop locally on your computer](https://github.com/tuftsdatalab/intro-r#running-the-workshop-locally-on-your-computer) *(requires the installation of both R and RStudio)*
